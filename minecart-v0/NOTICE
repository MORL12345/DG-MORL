We apologize for the negligence.
The video of the early stage of training process is not guaranteed to be generated by the agent.
It is the best demonstration in the agent's demonstration repository (can be the initial demo).
Nevertheless, the final video can still show that the policy achieves marginal improvement, though it is supposed to be larger.
We are fixing this problem now. @04/04/2024 14:32
