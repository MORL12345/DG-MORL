This repository is to show the abosulte performance of our DG-MORL algorithm comparing with the baseline algorithms we used in our work, i.e. GPI-PD and GPI-LS.
The term "absolute performance" is a comparison between the maximum performance achievable and the performance of the evaluated algorithms. 
We used the metric of "maximum utility loss" (MUL) to measure absolute performance which is also used in the work of Alegre et al. [1].



Figures MUL_DST.png, MUL_minecart.png, and MUL_MO_Hopper.png are respectively shown the gap between the algorithms performance and the maximum achievable performance.
